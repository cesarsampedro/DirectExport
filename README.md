# DirectExport
Direct Export is a Krita plugin that lets you export files to your last used location with all settings saved in your .kra file using a single shortcut.
Essentially, it provides a small window in the UI where you can export your .kra file (source) to formats like PNG,TGA etc with a predefined set of export settings. The .kra file internally saves the export settings and the final directory path, so all you need to do is open your Krita file and, with a click of the button or shortcut, the file will be exported to the correct directory as the final image. This is particularly useful for keeping your source files in one directory while ensuring you don’t have to remember the location or export settings for your final images.

### Manual installation
To install the plugin

1. Download the zip file in the https://github.com/cesarsampedro/DirectExport/releases/
2. Open Krita and go to Tools/Scripts/Import_Python_plugin_from_File and select the .zip file.
3. Go to Settings/Configure Krita/Keyboard Shortcuts and look for "Direct Export" and setup a shortcut like F12.
4. Open the Direct Export docker (Settings/Dockers/DirectExport) and it will appear in your krita UI.
